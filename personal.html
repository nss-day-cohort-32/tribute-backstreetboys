            <img class="main-pic" src="img/rock-main.jpg" alt="main-pic">          
            <p>Johnson was born on May 2, 1972, in Hayward, California, to Ata Johnson (n√©e Maivia) (b.1948) and former professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles) (b.1944). Johnson briefly lived in New Zealand with his mother's family, settling in Grey Lynn. He attended Richmond Road Primary School, before returning to the U.S. with his parents. In the United States, he attended Shepherd Glen Elementary School and Hamden Middle School in Hamden, Connecticut, then spent 10th grade at President William McKinley High School in Honolulu, Hawaii. As he entered 11th grade, his father's job required relocation to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where Johnson began playing football at Freedom High School in the East Penn Conference. He was also a member of the school's track and field and wrestling teams</p>
            <br>
            <p>As of 2014, Johnson resides in Southwest Ranches, Florida. In recognition of his service to the Samoan people, and because he is a descendant of Samoan chiefs, Johnson had the noble title of Seiuli bestowed upon him by Malietoa Tanumafili II during his visit there in July 2004. He received a partial Samoan pe'a tattoo on his left side in 2003, and in 2017 had the small "brahma bull" tattoo on his right arm covered with a larger half-sleeve tattoo of a bull's skull.</p>
